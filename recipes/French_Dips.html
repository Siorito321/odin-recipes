    <h1>Slow Cooker 3-Ingredient French Dips</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a super simple slow cooker recipe that
         needs just 3 ingredients for French 
        dip sandwiches. It's always a hit with my
         family! I love it served on French rolls;
          they soak up the au jus and taste great.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) beef brisket</li>
        <li>1 envelope onion soup mix</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can beef broth</li>
        <li>8 large French rolls, split</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place beef brisket in a slow cooker. Mix onion soup mix into
            beef broth in a small bowl; pour over brisket.</li>
        <li>Cook on Low 7 to 9 hours.</li>
        <li>Transfer brisket to a cutting board and cut into slices.
