    <h1>Crock Pot® Party Meatballs</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my most requested party recipe. People go crazy for
         these meatballs, and there is never a single one leftover
         at the end of a party or tailgate. The best part (aside
          from them being delicious) is that they are sooo easy to make!</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (2 pound) bag frozen cooked meatballs</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can whole berry cranberry sauce</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) bottle tomato-based chili sauce</li>
        <li>½ lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>2 drops hot sauce (such as Tabasco®), or more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place frozen meatballs into a slow cooker. Add cranberry sauce, 
            chili sauce, lemon juice, and hot sauce. Stir to distribute sauce
             evenly over meatballs.</li>
        <li>Cook on High until meatballs are completely thawed and hot, about 3 hours.</li>
    </ol>
