    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I make this dip recipe for my big football game parties every
         year, and everyone raves over it. 
        You can make it as spicy or as mild as you want.</p>

        <li>½ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®)</li>
        <li>3 large jalapeno peppers, chopped (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

        <li>Cook and stir pork sausage in a large skillet over medium heat 
            until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes; drain excess grease.</li>
